# 0x16. C - Simple Shell
 Team project of 2 people (team: Beniam Data, Betelhem Mesele)
Description:
The Simple Shell Implementation project is a programming project that aims to design and implement a basic shell, which is a command-line interface program that interprets user commands and executes them. The project covers topics such as process creation, memory management, signal handling, and system calls. The project requirements include using allowed editors (vi, vim, emacs), compiling on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, following the Betty style guide, including a README.md file, using include guards, avoiding memory leaks, and using system calls only when necessary. The project also specifies that the shell implementation should have the same output and error output as the sh (/bin/sh) program, and the error message should include the name of the program (argv[0]). The project provides a list of allowed functions and system calls, including access, chdir, execve, exit, fork, getpid, kill, malloc, open, read, strtok, wait, write, and others. The project covers topics such as manipulating the environment of the current process, creating processes, using the PATH to find programs, executing another program with the execve system call, suspending the execution of a process until one of its children terminates, and understanding the concept of EOF (end-of-file). The project also includes questions about the history of Unix, the Unix shell, the B programming language, and the role of Ken Thompson in the development of Unix.
